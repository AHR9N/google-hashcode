<h1 align="center">Google HashCode 2021</h1>

It was our first participation in HashCode, proudly to say we came in 12th place on Egypt and 892nd worldwide (with around 10k teams participating). Our final score was 9,504,210. It was quite fun and an amazing experience, trying to optimize our answers to the best of our capabilities. Time-consuming and interesting approaches by everyone, so far as I can see! And here, the solutions of Google HashCode 2021 Qualification Round.

## Our main approach 
It is quite simple! We greedily distributed the periods over streets based on the number of cars that would travel on that street. And randomly decided the ordering of the schedule per intersection. Dataset of D was a real challenge, yet we enjoyed the contest.

## Things we have learnt
There is no perfect solution as we usually do in competitive programming. It's about getting the best approach possible. Trying to aim a good balance between memory and processing while building a solution. Actually, you might submit a good solution for dataset A and a bad one for B and then submit a bad solution for A and a good one for B; while the best scoring of your submissions of each will be considered!
